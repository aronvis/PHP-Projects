# Mail Carrier Review Tracker
Tracks the performance of each USPS mail carrier by linking delivery reviews to mail carriers using the delivery date and address. Each delivery address gets translated into a delivery route using the USPS API. Once a delivery review contains a valid delivery route and date, it gets mapped to a specific mail carrier using their weekly schedule and delivery routes. The frontend is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend uses PHP and MySQL.
